          %p.section__content-paragraph In a previous life, believe it or not, I made pies. Empire was the name of my business, not only named after the apple, but also named after my hopes of being the ultimate grand supreme of the Toronto pie scene (yes, there’s a Toronto pie scene). Ultimately, Empire never took off, but it left us with a beautiful interface, rich with tasty interactions and imagery.

          %p.section__content-paragraph In an effort to centralize all the needs of Format users, a small team - 2 developers, 1 designer and 1 product manager - planned, designed and built a e-commerce platform from the ground up that allowed Format users to sell their products online. Working closely with design, I was responsible for building all the front-end components, as well as integration into Format Themes. I was also a key collaborator in conceptualizing interactions, flows and user stories.
