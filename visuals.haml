          %p.section__content-paragraph In a previous life, believe it or not, I made pies. Empire was the name of my business, not only named after the apple, but also named after my hopes of being the ultimate grand supreme of the Toronto pie scene (yes, there’s a Toronto pie scene). Ultimately, Empire never took off, but it left us with a beautiful interface, rich with tasty interactions and imagery.
