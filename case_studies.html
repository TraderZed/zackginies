After going over my experience and hearing about my passion towards it, almost everyone I spoke with said the same thing:<strong>“I’ve always wanted to volunteer, but it always seems so hard to get started.”</strong></p><p>Hearing that so many people had missed out on opportunities to volunteer was concerning. Could it really be that hard? What kinds of barriers were there? I decided to dig deeper into this phenomenon.</p></div><div class="info_block"><h3>Research & Discovery</h3><p>To gather more insights, I interviewed 5 people about their experiences with volunteering and, more importantly, about their desire to volunteer - I wanted to truly understand the motivations behind why people volunteer.</p></div><div class="callout_block"><div class="info_block"><h4>Four Major Findings</h4><ul class="callout_block__list"><li class="callout_block__list-item"><h6>The desire to volunteer is strong.</h6><p>People who volunteer truly believe that it is their duty and responsibility to do so.</p></li><li class="callout_block__list-item"><h6>The barriers to volunteering are high.</h6><p>Discovery and the application process is long and out-of-date.</p></li><li class="callout_block__list-item"><h6>Volunteering is social and community driven.</h6><p>People felt that volunteering connected them to their community.</p></li><li class="callout_block__list-item"><h6>Contributes to self worth.</h6><p>Many people expressed that volunteering gives them the ‘warm fuzzies’.</p></li></ul></div></div><blockquote>“You can see the impact on others and on yourself - it’s very heartwarming to see how small gestures impact someone else’s life.”<span>Marielle Fontaine, Interview Participant</span></blockquote></section></body></html>
