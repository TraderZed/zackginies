        %h3 Introduction
        %p
          In the spring of 2019, I was meeting several new people, and most of them seemed fascinated with my background in volunteer work. After going over my experience and hearing about my passion towards it, almost everyone I spoke with said the same thing:
          %strong “I’ve always wanted to volunteer, but it always seems so hard to get started.”
        %p Hearing that so many people had missed out on opportunities to volunteer was concerning. Could it really be that hard? What kinds of barriers were there? I decided to dig deeper into this phenomenon.

        %h3 Research & Discovery
        %p To gather more insights, I interviewed 5 people about their experiences with volunteering and, more importantly, about their desire to volunteer - I wanted to truly understand the motivations behind why people volunteer.
