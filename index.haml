        %h2 Tell me more!
        %p Structure and creativity gives me life. Manipulating data gets me all tingly. Readable and reusable code makes me feel like a magnificent hybrid of <a href="http://www.theresacaputo.com/" target="_blank" title="Theresa Caputo">Theresa Caputo's hair</a> and <a href="http://www.ifbbpro.com/features/iris-kyle-ms-olympia/" target="_blank" title="Iris Kyle">Iris Kyle</a>.
        %p Hi, I'm Zack, a Toronto based front-end developer, currently living the freelancer dream (GTL and eating instant noodles), having just left a stint building epic sh!t at <a href="http://teehanlax.com/" tite="Teehan+Lax" target="_blank">Teehan+Lax</a>.
        %p I’ve had the pleasure of working with some major brands like Stella Artois, Honda, KFC, and Bell, and also with some incredible local Toronto brands like The Black Hoof and This End Up.
        %p I also run a mega small pie shop called <a href="http://empirepies.com/" target="_blank" title="Empire Pies">Empire</a> and hold an annual charity pie baking marathon aptly titled <a href="http://thepiedrive.ca/" target="_blank" title="The Pie Drive">The Pie Drive</a>, because who doesn’t love pie?
        %p Oh! I'm also all over Git, so head over and <a href="https://github.com/TraderZed" target="_blank" title="Follow me on Git!">give me a follow</a>.
