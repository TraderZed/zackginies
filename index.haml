        Hi, I'm Zack!

          I'm kind of new here,
          %br
          but not really.
        %p After 10 years as a front-end developer, I've made the transition into role focused primarily on product and UX design. Don't worry, writing code and building beautiful interfaces still makes me feel like a magnificent hybrid of <a href="http://www.theresacaputo.com/" target="_blank" title="Theresa Caputo">Theresa Caputo's hair</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_Kyle" target="_blank" title="Iris Kyle">Iris Kyle</a>.
        %p Over the span of my 10 year career, I’ve had the pleasure of working with some major brands like Google, Starbucks, Stella Artois, Honda, KFC, and Bell, and also with some incredible local Toronto brands like The Black Hoof and Bar Isabel.
        %p Before making this transition, I was working with the fine folks over at <a href="http://www.format.com/" target="_blank" title="Format">Format.com</a>, and before that, I was building epic sh!t at <a href="http://teehanlax.com/" tite="Teehan+Lax" target="_blank">Teehan+Lax</a>.
        %p I'm also, like, totally hireable right now, so feel free to <a href="mailto:zack@zackginies.com" title="Email me!">slide into those DMs</a>. But before you do, you should know that I excel on teams that value data, technology, humanity and empathy.
